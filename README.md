我目前还是一名初中生，我喜欢时不时地捣鼓一下我喜欢的东西！因此我总是三分钟热度… 😔

I am still a junior high school student, and I like to fiddle with my favorite things from time to time! So I always have three minutes of heat … 😔

不过，希望我以后能够变得越来越优秀，成为一个能为社会做出贡献的人！ 😎

However, I hope I can become more and more outstanding in the future and become a person who makes contributions to society! 😎
